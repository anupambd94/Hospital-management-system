                                         EXISTING SYSTEM


The existing system uses manual transaction processing.

Drawbacks

1.	Large amount of clerical time is required. 

2.	The record maintainability is difficult. 

3.	Accessibility of accurate information from the past record is difficult. 

4.	There is always delay in information search and retrieval. It requires many people to carry out a single problem. 

5.	Lot of human resources is required. 

6.	Data reliability and maintainability is difficult.

7.	Lot amount of records need much place to save.

8.	The paper works have to be taken care. 

9.	The patient entry form may miss.

10.	The doctor appointment cannot be maintained in properly.















                           PROBLEM ANALYSIS

This project will automate the daily operations of LIFE LINE hospital. The project keeps track of the staff and patient (in-patient, out-patient) details. It also takes care of the ward, medical, invoice and the doctor’s appointment details. The system generates the daily ward availability, the status of the operation theatres and ICU.
HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT is an integrated Hospital Information
System, which addresses all the major functional areas of multi-specialty hospitals. The HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT enables better patient care, patient safety, patient confidentiality, efficiency, reduced costs and better management information system. It provides easy access to critical information thus enabling the management to take better decisions on time.
This project deals with processing of each and every department in the Hospital. This project sincerely aims to reduce the manual processing of each department. The Scope of the project takes care of the details of each and every Department. These details give the doctor, staffs, specialists and patient details including their salary, attendance, doctor’s appointments and the billing system. The details of Doctor and staff help the hospital to maintain the record of every person. Their attendance details help them to know about their attentive presence while salary is calculated. The billing system provides an efficient way for calculating bill details of the patients.







                                 
                                    Software Requirement Analysis

Visual Studio 2010  is a complete set of development tools for building
•	Desktop applications 
Visual Basic .NET, Visual C++ .NET, and Visual C# .NET all use the same integrated development environment (IDE), which allows them to share tools and facilitates in the creation of mixed-language solutions.
Visual C#, pronounced C sharp, is a new object-oriented programming language that is an evolution of C and C++, providing a simple and type-safe language for developing applications.
The .NET Framework
Overview
The .NET Framework is a new computing platform that simplifies application development in the highly distributed environment of the Internet. The .NET Framework is designed to fulfil the following objectives:
•	To provide a consistent object-oriented programming environment whether object code is stored and executed locally, executed locally but Internet-distributed, or executed remotely.
•	To provide a code-execution environment that minimizes software deployment and versioning conflicts.
•	To provide a code-execution environment that guarantees safe execution of code, including code created by an unknown or semi-trusted third party.
•	To provide a code-execution environment that eliminates the performance problems of scripted or interpreted environments.
•	To make the developer experience consistent across widely varying types of applications, such as Windows-based applications and Web-based applications.
The .NET Framework is a multi-language environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and applications.
•	Common Language Runtime Despite its name, the runtime actually has a role in both a component's runtime and development time experiences. While the component is running, the runtime is responsible for managing memory allocation, starting up and stopping threads and processes, and enforcing security policy, as well as satisfying any dependencies that the component might have on other components. At development time, the runtime's role changes slightly; because it automates so much (for example, memory management), the runtime makes the developer's experience very simple, especially when compared to COM as it is today. In particular, features such as reflection dramatically reduce the amount of code a developer must write in order to turn business logic into a reusable component. 
•	 ASP.NET ASP.NET builds on the programming classes of the .NET Framework, providing a Web application model with a set of controls and infrastructure that make it simple to build ASP Web applications. ASP.NET includes a set of controls that encapsulate common HTML user interface elements, such as text boxes and drop-down menus. These controls run on the Web server, however, and push their user interface as HTML to the browser. On the server, the controls expose an object- oriented programming model that brings the richness of object-oriented programming to the Web developer. ASP.NET also provides infrastructure services, such as session state management and process recycling that further reduce the amount of code a developer must write and increase application reliability.

SQL SERVER

SQL server is a client/server relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses transact-SQL to send request between a client and SQL server.
Client/server Architecture
SQL server is designed to be a client/server system. Client/server systems are constructed so that the database can reside on a central computer, known as a server, and be shared among several users. When users want to access the date in SQL server, they run an application on their local computer, known as a client that connects over a network to the server running SQL server. SQL server can work with thousands of client applications simultaneously. The server has features to prevent the logical problems that occur if a user tries to read or modify data currently being used by others.

Project Legacy




I learnt about .NET framework Platform, asp.net and C# programming.
And learn how to deal with real life situation problems. Using These Technology:-
.NET framework Platform:
The .NET Framework is a new computing platform that simplifies application development in the highly distributed environment of the Internet.
ASP.NET:
Asp.net is a web application development platform to create websites, desktop application etc.
ADO (ActiveX Data Objects).Net:
  As you develop applications using ADO.NET, you will have different requirements for working with data. In some cases, you might simply want to display data on a form. In other cases, you might need to devise a way to share information with another company. No matter what you do with data, there are certain fundamental concepts that you should understand about the data approach in ADO.NET. You might never need to know some of the details of data handling — for example, you might never need to directly edit an XML file containing data.
